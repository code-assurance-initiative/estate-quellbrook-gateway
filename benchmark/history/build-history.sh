# Rebuilds the scripted history of this benchmark repository, deterministically.
#
# The history is part of the benchmark's input: churn, ownership, knowledge freshness, change coupling, sprint trends
# and history-only findings are read from it. Its 24 commits (2026-07-27 .. 2026-09-04, three two-week
# sprints) are stored as patches in ./patches (NNNN.patch, one per commit, in order, as written by
# `git format-patch -k`), each carrying its fictional author and date. This script applies them on top of the
# key-first commit with the committer set to the author and the committer date to the author date, and re-creates the
# sprint release tags. Every input of a commit object is fixed, so the result is byte-identical to the published
# history: the script checks the final commit id and every tag target.
#
# The authors are fictional (neutral invented names under the reserved .invalid domain). Commits after the scripted
# history (the answer key's maintenance, this script, the journal) are real benchmark maintenance.
#
# Usage: benchmark/history/build-history.sh <new-directory>
#   Run from any full (non-shallow) clone of this repository; <new-directory> must not exist. The rebuilt history is
#   left on branch `scripted` in <new-directory>.
